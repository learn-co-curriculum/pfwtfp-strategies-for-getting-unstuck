## Introduction

It happens to all developers at some point: you're on a coding roll, and then you hit a rough patch you can't get out of. When you find yourself stuck in a problem, you'll want a series of steps you can take to reconsider the problem, apply different solutions and get yourself back on track.

### State Strategies for Getting Unstuck

- Generalized ideas for problem solving based on Claude Shannon methodology (as outlined here: https://qz.com/1365059/a-universal-way-to-solve-problems-from-a-mathematical-genius/):
  - Build a core before filling the details
  - Restructure and contrast
  - Multiply the essence of every input

- Other notes on the steps of the methodology:
  - Simplify
  - Learn and think about similar problems and solutions
  - Approach the problem from different angles
  - Break the problem into small parts
  - Solve the problem backwards from the solution
  - Extend your solution as far as it will go

## Conclusion

If you find yourself stuck in a coding problem, following a methodology of problem solving will help untangle the issue and help you get yourself unstuck.
